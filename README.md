# Hey, I'm Sourav üëã 

I love building products for fun, either to solve problems I encounter or to address something that truly needs a solution.  
I have worked as a Product Engineer with multiple startups in my past life.  

### What I‚Äôm working on now üöÄ  
Since last year (2024), I‚Äôve been focused on building tools that will help people develop autonomous robots. One such project is **[Rigit.io](https://rigit.io)**.
Right now, I'm focused on building better simulations for robots and AI to learn from.
