# Hey, I'm Sourav 👋 

I love building products for fun, either to solve problems I encounter or to address something that truly needs a solution.  
I have worked as a Product Engineer with multiple startups in my past life.  

### What I’m working on now 🚀  
Since last 1 year (2024), I’ve been focused on building tools that will help people develop autonomous robots. One such project is **[Rigit.io](https://rigit.io)**.
Right now, I'm focused on building better simulations for robots and AI to learn from. I'm diving into Rust, and you'll see a series of games and projects emerging as I learn and build with it.
