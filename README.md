# Hey everyone, I'm Sourav 👋  

I love building products for fun—either to solve problems I encounter or to address something that truly needs a solution.  

I have worked as a Product Engineer with multiple startups in the past.  

### What I’m working on now 🚀  
For the past year, I’ve been focused on building tools that help people develop autonomous robots. One such project is **[Rigit.io](https://rigit.io)**, a step toward making robotics development more accessible.  

I believe in **open-source development** as a way to reach a global audience and maximize impact. Turning some of my projects open source and building in public is my way of sharing knowledge and learning from the community.  

I welcome both **honest critique** and **encouragement** on this journey.  

### My Open Source Projects 🛠️  
Below are some projects that are currently public. You can:  
- Run them locally with your own API keys and environment variables.  
- Create issues for feature requests.  
- Build on top of my previous projects—just reach out!  

If you’re interested in extending any of my work, feel free to message me on **[Twitter/X](https://x.com/sourav_bz)**. I’d be happy to share my learnings so you can avoid common pitfalls and reach your goals faster.

**We are gonna make it!** ✊
